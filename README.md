# Project 1: BMI Calculator App

**Description:**  
This project involves creating an Android application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. The app features a simple UI where users can input their weight and height, and the calculated BMI is displayed.

**What I Learned:**

- Developing Android applications with Java.
- Implementing basic UI components like `EditText` and `TextView`.
- Handling user interactions with event listeners.
- Using static methods for calculations and formatting in Java.

**Note:** A JUnit test file is provided to ensure the correctness of the BMI calculation logic.

# Project 2: Java Control Structures Practice

**Description:**  
This project contains a series of utility methods that reinforce the use of Java control structures. These methods perform tasks such as counting integers in a range, converting seconds to minutes and seconds, calculating fractions raised to an exponent, and computing a balance after interest.

**What I Learned:**

- Mastery of Java control structures including loops, conditionals, and method creation.
- Understanding of how to implement algorithms without relying on arrays or other Java library classes.
- Importance of handling edge cases and adhering to strict problem constraints.

**Note:** A JUnit test file is provided for testing the functionality of each method.

# Project 4: Vending Machine Simulation

**Description:**  
This project simulates a vending machine with a limited number of products. The vending machine can add and dispense products, and it provides feedback on stock levels and invalid operations.

**What I Learned:**

- Implementing a class-based structure to simulate real-world objects.
- Managing state and behavior in a Java class.
- Writing methods that manipulate class fields and provide feedback to users.

**Note:** A JUnit test file is included to verify the vending machine's operations.

# Project 5: Course Registration System

**Description:**  
This project models a simple course registration system. It involves managing student registrations, tracking grades, and generating GPA reports. The system also includes functionality for assigning instructors to courses and updating marks.

**What I Learned:**

- Designing and implementing object-oriented models in Java.
- Handling associations between objects (e.g., students and courses, instructors and courses).
- Using arrays to manage multiple registrations and ensuring that the system enforces constraints (e.g., maximum registrations).

**Note:** A JUnit test file is provided to validate the functionality of the registration system.

# Project 6: Utilities for Array Manipulation

**Description:**  
This project consists of utility methods that perform various operations on arrays, such as finding multiples of 3, generating all prefixes, grouping numbers based on divisibility, and flattening a 2D array in a zigzag pattern.

**What I Learned:**

- Advanced array manipulation techniques in Java.
- Implementation of algorithms that involve iterating through arrays in non-trivial ways.
- Debugging and testing complex logic within array operations.

**Note:** A JUnit test file is available to test each utility method's correctness.

# Project 7: Auto Shop Management System

**Description:**  
This project models an auto shop where a collection of vehicles is managed by an owner. The shop supports operations such as adding vehicles, selling them, and transferring ownership. The system ensures that no duplicate vehicles are added.

**What I Learned:**

- Working with collections in Java, specifically `HashSet` and `List`.
- Implementing deep and shallow copies of collections.
- Handling exceptions to enforce business rules (e.g., preventing duplicate vehicles).

**Note:** A JUnit test file is included to verify the operations of the auto shop system.
